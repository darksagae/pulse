Major improvements to image processing:

1. Image Merging
   - Automatically combines multiple images into one
   - Side-by-side layout for ID cards
   - Better AI extraction from both sides

2. Image Optimization
   - Removes all size limits
   - Automatic compression for large images
   - Binary search for optimal quality
   - Fits within Gemini API limits (3.5MB)

3. Enhanced UX
   - Visual feedback during optimization
   - Clear status messages
   - Detailed console logging
